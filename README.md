## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Glad you came by!

I'm **Beabkal**. A full-stack engineer

I build web applications using JavaScript, Java and Python. I use React and Tailwind CSS for frontend and Node.js, Express and MongoDB for backend. I also use other tech stacks such as Django, Laravel and relational databases such as MySQL depending on functional requirements.

When I'm not developing or learning a new skill, you will find me on Duolingo practicing my Spanish, writing an article, listening to history podcasts or reading classical literature.

I have recently started blogging. Join me at [Hashnode](https://beabkal.hashnode.dev/) or [Dev.to](https://dev.to/beabkal).
