## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Glad you came by!

I'm **Beabkal**. A full-stack engineer

I build we applications using JavaScript. I use React and Tailwind CSS for frontend and Node.js, Express and MongoDB for backend. I also use other tech stacks such as Django, Laravel and relational datanases such as MySQL depending on functional requirements.

When I'm not developing or studying, you can find me on Duolingo practicing my Spanish, writing an article, listening to history podcasts or reading classical literature.

I have recently started blogging about Computer Science stuff. Join me at [Hashnode](https://beabkal.hashnode.dev/) or [Dev.to](https://dev.to/beabkal).
